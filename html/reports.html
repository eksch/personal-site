                <p>The scrap metal trade may seem like a niche industry, but it's a key component in recycling resources and transforming them into something new.</p>
                <p>The basic concept: Someone has leftover metal from a product they've made, a scrapyard ships it to a buyer who can melt it down and use it for something else. It's a billion-dollar industry &mdash; that, unfortunately, is plagued with fraudsters who take advantage of humanity's need to recycle our resources.</p>
                
                <h2>Addressing the problem</h2>
                <p>How do these fraudsters operate? One example: they like to impersonate reputable individuals, or fabricate business histories to trick real professionals into paying them for scrap that doesn't exist.</p>
                <p>Scrap Connection (now <a href="https://tradefox.co/" targe="_blank">Tradefox</a>) aims to take on these bad actors by bringing transparency to the industry. By gathering publicly available data from disparate sources, they were able to uncover a story of how trustworthy a company is based on past behavior.</p>
                <p>But, while gathering data can be done programatically, they were struggling to analyze and organize the data in a meaningful way for the myriad of companies and business practices in the industry.</p>
                <p>I was asked to take the initial idea of collating this data and build it into a scalable, automated, always-up-to-date report that could be accessed by anyone who needed to verify trade partners.</p>
