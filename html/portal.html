                <p class="project-intro">A section of the first project I worked on was the Disease & Catastrophic Profiler. While the product it's a part of looks at general healthcare data and highlights anomalies and areas of high cost, the Profiler specifically shows prevalence of diseases in various demographics.</p>
                
                <p>Joyously, we also were able to consider mobile first with this project.</p>
                
                
                <p>To start, we had to simplify how users chose the profiler they were looking at, Disease or Catastrophic. By putting this as the first step, instead of hurling the user into all the data and hoping they’d find what they needed, we eliminated confusion about where you were in the site and provided a clear path forward. </p>

                <p>After a profiler is selected, the user is presented with a search within that set of data. Since it’s a defined set, we made the results live-updating as the user typed. The categories and individual diseases below will filter away if they don’t match the term, or sequence of letters. </p>
                
                <p>If they know the category of what they’re looking for, they can also click on that and see a list of diseases, or view an aggregate of all the data for diseases in that category. </p>
                
                
                <p class="top-margin">On the disease details page, we needed to make the data easy to navigate and simple to understand. We added a jump navigation so the user could see all the graphs available on the page without needing to scroll through them all, and navigate to the one they needed most. I used some simple Javascript to accomplish this, peep the Codepen prototype below.</p>

                <p>A feature on each page also allows the user to switch between the two profilers, and retain their position in the site, to easily compare data between the two. </p>
