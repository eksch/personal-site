                <p>Many consumers, myself included, are familiar with leaving reviews. Restaurants, hotels, purchases&hellip; all these and more are subjected to our opinions, in the interest of helping a future consumer make an informed choice.</p>
                
                <p>But what about when reviews are between businesses, in an industry where your business relationships are worth more than gold? How do you review a transaction without putting your business in jeopardy?</p>
                
                <p>This was our challenge in building a review system for the scrap trade.</p>
                
                <h2>The Manual Route</h2>
                <p>Bearing in mind that participants in this industry are hesitant to provide honest feedback on their business partners, yet are quite keen to hear what their business partners had to say about them, we started a feedback process that was entirely manual.</p>
                <p>This meant calling our users and asking them specific questions, based on whether they bought or sold as their primary business action.</p>
                            
                <figure class="image image__full">
                    <img src="../images/review_old.png" />

                    <figcaption>Questions asked about buyers. Naturally, we kept track of it all in a spreadsheet</figcaption>
                </figure>
                            
                <p>This manual process showed that people were willing to give feedback, as long as they felt it was being handled responsibly and confidentially.</p>

                
                <h2>Leveraging public trade data</h2>
                <p>We entered each review manually for each company, keeping the data anonymized. But this wasn't scalable &mdash; in order to make the reviews meaningful for others, we needed a lot more of them. That meant that we needed to automate how we discovered a trade occurred, and allow traders to review them, without us picking up the phone.</p>
                
                <p>When we find trades a company participated in, they receive a weekly roundup of trades to review.</p>

                <p>The priority order of the search result filters was based on what people said their deciding factors were. Often, they would check the "Non-Stop" filter immediately after searching, and then order by price.</p>

                    <figcaption>Select an outbound flight. </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Once they'd selected both their outgoing and return flights, we showed a summary of their entire itinerary, with a link to book the flight.</p>

                <figure class="image image__full">
                    <img src="../images/review_email_you-were-reviewed.png" class="main-image" />
                    <figcaption>Route summary before booking</figcaption>
                </figure>
            
                <p>We ran tests with customers using this prototype, to see if they understood the process of building their flight itinerary one flight at a time.</p>
                <p>While many of the younger participants picked up on the pattern quickly, and liked that you could see which parts of the trip were more expensive, most users overall found it too "jumpy" &mdash; if you wanted to change your flight, you had to go back to previous screens and redo your trip build.</p>
            
                <h2>Prototype #2: Choose a round trip</h2>
                <p>From our initial research, we had discovered that many people used Skyscanner to research prices and available flights. It's possible that since they were used to that interface, they wanted to see the price of the whole trip in one go.</p>
                <p>So, I built a new design for selecting a round trip, all at once.</p>
                <figure class="image image__full">
                    <img src="../images/review_full-listing_with-reviews.png" class="main-image" />
                    <figcaption>Search results with full return trips</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>As with any experience, the details blur and fade over time. Over a period of six months, a company may have had tens, or even hundreds, of trades with the same company. How would they know exactly which trade they were reviewing?</p>
                <p>We still wanted the trader to review their experience with a company, even if time has passed. Six months after the trade arrived at its destination, the trade becomes <b>historic</b> &mdash; and the trader reviews their general experience with the counterparty. Those scores get averaged across all trades they had with them during that time.</p>

                </figure>
                
                <p>Since we'd be linking to our partners' websites for the users to complete their transactions, we had to make it clear where they'd be heading when they clicked book.</p>
                
                
                
                <h2>Result</h2>
                <p>While you can't see this solution implemented on Booking.com anymore, I learned a ton while working on and building this project.</p>
                <p>Despite any or all efforts, a personal preference for how something should work may creep in to a design. In this project, my personal love of airport codes and building my own trip was not the way that most people preferred to find their flights.</p>
                <p>Eventually, through research, testing, and iteration, I was able to filter out my bias and put the product into context, and truly build something people want.</p>
